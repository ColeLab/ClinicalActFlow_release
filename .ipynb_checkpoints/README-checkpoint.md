This code was run on a compute cluster at Rutgers (https://oarc.rutgers.edu/). The intention of this code release is to enable others to adapt and use the code for their needs - not as a package. If you are interested in the analyses I point you towards the [_activity flow toolbox_](https://colelab.github.io/ActflowToolbox/), a proper code base with documentation etc.,

Feel free to e-mail me with questions.
