This code was run on a compute cluster at Rutgers (https://oarc.rutgers.edu/). The intention of this code release is to enable others to adapt and use the code for their needs. If you are interested in the analyses I would recommend you check out the [__activity flow toolbox__](https://colelab.github.io/ActflowToolbox/) developed by the Cole Lab. The toolbox contains user friendly functions and documentation to perform activity flow mapping. Its development has continued after this project finished, so it would be best practice to use the toolbox (rather than this code).
